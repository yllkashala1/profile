  <h4>Hi, my name is Yllka. I'm from Kosovo and i moved to Germany two years ago.
    <br>Over time, i realized that i like to do different things. I have had some experiences in the field of education and lecturing. And in the field of medicine and also lecturing in this field as well.
    <br>During my journey and getting to know different people, i started to understand that i would like to have some skills in the field of programming too. For this reason, i decided to be part of LeWagon Bootcamp in Munich, Germany!
    <br>Now i'm open to work as a Junior Full Stack Developer.<br>In the bottom you can find all the informations about me.</br>
